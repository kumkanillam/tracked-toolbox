# How To Contribute

This repo is divided into multiple packages using Yarn workspaces:

- `tracked-toolbox` is the actual `tracked-toolbox` addon
- `test-app` contains `tracked-toolbox` test suite

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/tracked-tools/tracked-toolbox.git`
* `cd tracked-toolbox`
* `yarn install`

## Linting

* `yarn lint`
* `yarn lint:fix`

## Running tests

* `cd tracked-toolbox && yarn start` – Builds the addon in "watch mode" so changes picked up by test app.
* `cd test-app && ember test` – Runs the test suite on the current Ember version
* `cd test-app && ember test --server` – Runs the test suite in "watch mode"
* `cd test-app && ember try:each` – Runs the test suite against multiple Ember versions

During development, if you'd like test app to pick up changes in the addon, make sure to run both
`cd tracked-toolbox && yarn start` and `cd test-app && ember test --server` in different terminals.

## Running the test-app application

* `ember serve`
* Visit the dummy application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
